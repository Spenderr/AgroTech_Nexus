# AgroTech_Nexus
We, team AgroTech Nexus, recently participated in Ecothon, a three-day hackathon held from May 10-12, where my team and I developed an innovative project aimed at optimizing water usage in agriculture. We created an interface for a system that repurposes wastewater generated from farm irrigation. Our solution integrates the drip irrigation technique and employs an Arduino Uno to monitor soil humidity levels. Additionally, it utilizes a weather API to make informed decisions about irrigation schedules. The system checks daily weather forecasts to determine if it will rain, ensuring that plants are only watered when necessary. This approach not only conserves water but also enhances the efficiency of agricultural practices by preventing over-irrigation.
